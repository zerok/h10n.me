I love Torchwood and Doctor Who but for some reason have never tried one of the
novels in that universe before. That is now over ðŸ˜‰ Published in 2007, *Another
Life* is the first novel about the Torchwood 3 crew and plays probably somewhere
during the first season of the show. Curious if it will be as entertaining as
the show!
