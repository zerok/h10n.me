Recently (March 2016) while scanning my to-read list on Pocket I stumbled upon
an [article by Kevin Albert][ka] about Impact Mapping, a technique for making
sure that what you're working on actually makes sense in the big
picture. Imagine my surprise when, while moving from one office to another, I
found the book mentioned in this article on a desk. Two days later I had
borrowed it ðŸ˜‰
