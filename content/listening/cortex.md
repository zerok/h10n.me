A life-style podcast with CGP Grey and Myke Hurley and possibly the weirdest
item on my weekly playlist. I mostly listen to it for getting different tooling
and workflow ideas.

Somewhen in April 2016 I stopped listening to this one simply because I didn't
get anything out of it anymore. I know my toolchain and it is working well for
me. There are also too many side-topics going on here that don't help me in any
possible way.
