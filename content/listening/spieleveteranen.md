I stumbled upon this in mid 2015 and it has become one of my favorite shows
nearly instantaneously. Back when I was very young I often went to a friend who
already had a PC that was powerful enough to play some of the hot games back
then (Duke Nukem 3D, Eurofighter, ...). We were also both very much into German
gaming magazines like PC Player and PC Games (and later Gamestar), of which
esp. PC Player was known for their rather goofy videos where they made fun of
the work you do at such magazines. They were simply great and also created a
weird but special bond between the reader and the editorial staff.

Well, Spieleveteranen features many of the people who worked on these magazines
back then so this podcast is pure nostalgia for me. They even pick issues from
back then and talk about their by now nearly 20 year old reviews!
