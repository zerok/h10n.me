On my search for a general JavaScript podcast I accidentally stumbled upon
JavaScript Jabber somewhen around
[episode 183](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/183-jsj-should-i-go-to-college-) (end
of October 2015) and stuck with it. It's a nice interview-podcast with a more or
less fixed panel of hosts with different experience levels.
